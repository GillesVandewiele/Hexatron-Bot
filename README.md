A simple, but strong, bot that is based on a heuristic in which we calculate the difference between tiles we can reach first and the number of tiles our opponent can reach first.

# Running the code

Clone the [simulator repository](https://github.com/pvmolle/hexatron) and run `python simulator.py agent.py agent.py` to let the agent play against itself. Open the generated `replay.html` file to the game.
